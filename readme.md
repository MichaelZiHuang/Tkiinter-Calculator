<h1> Basic Calculator </h1>

My brief discovery of this library and led to to making the all important basic function that every GUI should do, a basic calculator.
It supports the basic addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction operators, but thanks to Python's Eval function, it will support
Sin, tan, and cos through the input table as well! Fun times.
